                        Cancel your WebDNA trial or subscription

                    <p>
                        When you subscribe to WebDNA, your subscription will automatically renew, and you will be
                        charged at
                        the start of each billing cycle. You must cancel your subscription before the end of your
                        current
                        billing cycle to avoid being charged for the following billing period.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="p-t-60">Subscriptions refund and cancellation policy</h4>

                    <p>
                        Once the monthly subscription fee has been charged at the start of a new billing cycle, you have
                        7
                        working days (14 days for users in the European Union) from the start of your first paid billing
                        cycle to cancel your subscription for a refund.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you cancel your subscription, you can continue using your subscription until the end of the
                        billing period during which you cancel. After the end of that billing period, you won't be able
                        to
                        access subscription features or music content. If you don't cancel within the time period
                        eligible
                        for a refund, you won't be refunded for the billing period during which you cancel.

                        After you've canceled your account, if you subscribe again, your reports and data will be
                        restored.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="p-t-60">Free trial cancellation policy</h4>

                    <p>
                        You won't be billed for trying out the services during your introductory trial period. If you
                        don't
                        cancel your subscription before the end of that trial, you will start to be billed. Once youâ€™ve
                        canceled your one-time free trial, your account will no longer have the option to try a
                        subscription
                        for free.
