                Main feature of WebDNA.io is a toxic link detection. Itâ€™s a useful tool for website owners
                whose sites have been banned or penalized by a search engine, because some inbound links have been
                considered as spam. Due to Google's intransparency, we observe a strong global demand for application
                that helps them quickly detect and disavow such links.
