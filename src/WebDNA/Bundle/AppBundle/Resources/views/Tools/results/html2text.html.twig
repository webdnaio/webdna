                <p class="p-t-20">
                    Every website is written in HTML code and the content displayed as text. The text/HTML ratio is the
                    percentage of actual text content found in a web page. Text â€“ HTML ratio of a web page should be
                    balanced. Website with very low text - html ratio is most likely to appear invisible in the search
                    engines (Google, Yahoo and Bing).

                <h5>What Is the Best Text/HTML Ratio?</h5>
                <p class="p-t-20">
                    The aspect ratio should be at least 10% for text and 90% or less for HTML. The more text you have,
                    your webpage will have better performance on search engines. Since newest upgrades of Google and
                    other search engines focus more on content, so the text ratio could be more important to get rank
                    higher in the SERPs.
